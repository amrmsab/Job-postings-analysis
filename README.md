# Job-postings-analysis
This is my take at analyzing the data of the 2018 Kaggle survey of Machine Learning and Data Science professionals. 
The goal was to do a step-by-step approach to analyzing the data and being able to predict what 
salary a professional in the field would make given his experience, job location, skills, academic background, etc.

The code is commented throughout. I will be using mainly Pandas and Numpy libraries to clean and process the data (which you can get from 
https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018). Following that I will be focusing on the use of Logistic regression to 
classify what salary bracket you might fall in after accumulating certain experience and skills. 

## Tools we'll be using:
1) Numpy and Pandas
2) Sklearn's Logistic Regression classifier

## To whom this is targetted
Students who want to learn the basics of processing csv file data and build their first ML model
I focus much on the preliminary data analysis so that you get a feel of what goes in a data science project before any of the 
code is written
